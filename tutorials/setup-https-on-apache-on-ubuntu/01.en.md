## Introduction

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the standard protocal name to exchange information using [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) on the web.

In this guide we'll setup the HTTPS connection on a LAMP stack based on Ubuntu, using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) a free certifier for you to use. One advantae of LE is the availbility of a tool named [Certobt](https://certbot.eff.org/) that automatically takes care of obatingn and maintaing the certificates for you.

**Prerequisites**

Thise tutorial ssumes that yo ualready have:
* A working Ubuntu installation with Apache working
* A registered domain `<example.com>`
* A DNS configured with `<example.com>` and `<www.example.com>`
Un DNS registrato n itsi tutorial 
If there are any prerequisites for your tutorial, please write them out here.
If there is already a tutorial explaining one of the prerequisites, make sure to link to that other tutorial.

## Step 1 - <Summary of Step>

Steps are the actual steps users will be taking to complete your tutorial.
Each step should build on the previous one, until the final step that finishes the tutorial.
It is important not to skip any steps, no matter how obvious or self-explanatory they may seem.
Feel free to include screenshots, to show exactly what the user should be seeing. Please put screenshots in a separate "images" folder.
The amount of steps will depend entirely on how long/complicated the tutorial is.
